# ICAN-Past-Question-Extractor-
A Python tool that automatically scrapes ICAN past question PDFs (2018–2025) from the ICAN Pathfinder website and uploads them to a Supabase S3-compatible storage bucket. The project is designed to be lossless, re-runnable, and duplicate-safe, making it perfect for personal study systems or internal educational platforms.
